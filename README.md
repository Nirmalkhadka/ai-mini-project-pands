![Hand Sign Detection](path/to/your/project/image.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Hand Sign Detection project! This project aims to detect and recognize hand signs using a machine learning model. The data branch contains a range of 3000 hand sign images that can be used for training and testing purposes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Contains the hand sign images for training and testing.
- **`model/`**: Placeholder for the trained machine learning model.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the hand sign detection algorithm.
- **`contributing.md`**: Guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies (list them if needed)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-sign-detection.git
   cd hand-sign-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Training the Model:**
   - If you have additional images, consider adding them to the `data/` directory.
   - Use the provided scripts in the `src/` directory to train the hand sign detection model.

2. **Testing the Model:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset.

3. **Contributing:**
   - See the `contributing.md` file for guidelines on how to contribute to the project.

## Dataset Information

The `data/` branch contains a range of 3000 hand sign images. This dataset is preprocessed and ready for use in training and testing machine learning models for hand sign detection.
